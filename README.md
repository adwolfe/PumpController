# Pump Controller





### Additional notes

This software is compatible with both the New Era NE-1000 or NE-1002 models of syringe pumps. You should ideally get two of the same kind. You will need to also purchase the FW-1-X firmware upgrade to be able to use the linear ramp feature of this program. If you purchase the FW-2-X upgrade, it will allow you to create very complex protocols (maximum phases for the pump is 41 in the base model, and 340 for the X2 firmware). 

A USB driver for the EPU357 conductivity meter (needed for use with Windows) can be [downloaded from here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240329124720/https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDM212364_Setup.zip).
